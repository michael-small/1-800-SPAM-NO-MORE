# 1-800-SPAM-NO-MORE
An exercise of my regex skills. I thought to myself one day: my phone marks potential spam texts. It likely uses machine learning and spam databases, but I thought to myself: "What regex expressions could mark potential spam?"  

This project will utilize multiple categories of approaches. For example, the first approach as seen in `Vanilla HTML +JS/index.html` uses vanilla HTML/CSS. It is ugly and it hurts. No libraries. Inline JS. Very gross, but super basic. 

This vanilla HTML/JS approach seeks to only use regex functions, purposely avoiding string/array methods like `.includes()` of `String.prototype` or `Array.prototype`. I will eventually move onto those, but this first exercise 
is to focus on pure regex. This should help me apply regex to other languages.
